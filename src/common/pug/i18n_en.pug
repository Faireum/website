                A2: 'Both traditional and centralized gaming have shortcomings in terms of transparency, processing efficiency, security, reliability, privacy and anonymity. Decentralized gaming can avoid these problems efficiently. but at present, the support from the popular public chain is limited and insufficient on the followings aspects, like processing efficiency, industry protocols, underlying capabilities, and RNG algorithms. Moreover, There is no good solution for asset disposal, the volatility of chips during the gaming, as well as the exchange of various assets. Faireum combines the security and transparency, distinctive features of public chain, and incorporates many original features such as diverse protocols, native capabilities, multiple algorithms, cross-chain asset swap, and capacity of parallel business expansion. We endeavor to build a public-chain ecosystem based on protocols of gaming industry, to be safe and fair, efficient in processing, stable of chip value and to support a variety industry models accompanied with capability of real-time exchange of various assets. Faireum public chain ecosystem is 100% contribute to the gaming industry.',
                A3: 'A protocol can be understood as a collection of attributes, rules, and definitions. It is an abstract representation of a set of common things or events. Everyone can extend specific functions, operations, implementations, etc. based on this foundation. Just as the common characteristics of human beings in nature can be abstracted into agreements, and each individual\'s independent character, ability, appearance, etc. is an extension of this agreement. In Faireum, the entire betting public chain ecosystem is built through these highly refined abstract protocols.',
                A4: 'As a decentralized public chain + protocol solution, Faireum guarantees the fairness and transparency of the whole system through the open source underlying framework, system framework and game contracts, while the state, data and settlement information in the game process are recorded on the blockchain. Public ledger records, these characteristics are inherently superior to the design of centralized systems. Compared with other decentralized systems or public chains, Faireum follows the standard of ârandomâ and âtransparentâ, providing a purely random underlying chain from block generation, consensus algorithm, multi-layer structure to virtual machine design, which provides a number of templates and features that can serve the gaming industry. This makes Faireum be the most suitable ecosystem in the gaming industry.',
